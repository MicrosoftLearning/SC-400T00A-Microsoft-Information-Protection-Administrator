# Lab 2 - Exercise 2 - Manage Endpoint DLP

You are Joni Sherman, the newly hired Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company offering driving instruction in the United States and you need to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization. For this reason, you decide to not only implement Microsoft 365 DLP policies but extend this protection to devices in your organization.

## Task 1 â€“ Enable device onboarding

In this task, you will turn on device onboarding for your organization.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **`https://purview.microsoft.com`** and log into the Microsoft Purview portal as **Joni Sherman**. sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). Joni's password was set in a previous exercise.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **`https://purview.microsoft.com`**, then select the **Settings** card.

1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Device onboarding** then select **Devices**.

1. On the **Devices** page, select **Turn on device onboarding** to enable the solution for your tenant.

1. Accept the **Turn on device onboarding** dialog by selecting **OK**.

1. Accept the **Device monitoring is being turned on** dialog by selecting **OK**.

You have now enabled device onboarding and can start to onboard devices to be protected with Endpoint DLP policies. The process of enabling the feature might take up to 30 minutes, but you can proceed with the next task as it's not dependent on this.

## Task 2 - Onboard a device to Endpoint DLP

In this task, you will use the local script option to onboard a Windows 10 device to allow it to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

1. Log into Client 2 VM (SC-400-CL2) as the **SC-400-cl1\admin** account.

1. On the **Add cloud service domain** flyout page in the **Domain** field enter _dropbox.com_ then select the **+** to the right. Select **Save** to save this setting.

1. Close the browser window.

You have now configured custom settings for your Endpoint DLP policies. Every policy you create will ignore content in the folder you configured and the Google Chrome browser has been added as unallowed browser to handle sensitive data.

## Task 5 - Configure Microsoft Purview Extension

As Compliance Administrator you need to evaluate the new business requirement of rolling out the Chrome browser to several users for working with sensitive data. For this test, you will install the Google Chrome browser to Client 01 and then add the Purview Compliance Extension for Google manually from the Google web store.

1. Open the Edge browser from the task bar.
