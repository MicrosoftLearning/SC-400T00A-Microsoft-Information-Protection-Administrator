# Lab 2 – Exercise 2 – Manage endpoint DLP

You are Joni Sherman, the newly hired Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company offering driving instruction in the United States and you need to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization. For this reason, you decide to not only implement Microsoft 365 DLP policies but extend this protection to devices in your organization.

**Tasks**:

1. Enable device onboarding
1. Onboard a device to endpoint DLP
1. Create an endpoint DLP policy
1. Configure Endpoint DLP settings
1. Configure Microsoft Purview extension

## Task 1 – Enable device onboarding

In this task, you'll enable device onboarding for your organization.

1. Log into Client 1 VM (SC-400-CL1) as the **SC-400-CL1\admin** account.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **`https://purview.microsoft.com`** and log into the Microsoft Purview portal as **Joni Sherman**. sign in as `JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com` (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). Joni's password was set in a previous exercise.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **`https://purview.microsoft.com`**, then select **Settings** from the left sidebar.

1. In the left sidebar, expand **Device onboarding** then select **Devices**.

1. On the **Devices** page, select **Turn on device onboarding** to enable the solution for your tenant.

1. Accept the **Turn on device onboarding** dialog by selecting **OK**.

1. Accept the **Device monitoring is being turned on** dialog by selecting **OK**.

You have now enabled device onboarding and can start to onboard devices to be protected with Endpoint DLP policies. The process of enabling the feature might take up to 30 minutes, but you can proceed with the next task as it's not dependent on this.

## Task 2 – Onboard a device to endpoint DLP

In this task, you will use the local script option to onboard a Windows 11 device to allow it to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.
