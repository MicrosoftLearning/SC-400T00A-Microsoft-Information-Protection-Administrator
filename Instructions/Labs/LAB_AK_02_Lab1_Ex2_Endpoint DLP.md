# Lab 2 - Exercise 2 - Manage Endpoint DLP

You are Joni Sherman, the newly hired Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company offering driving instruction in the United States and you need to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization. For this reason, you decide to not only implement Microsoft 365 DLP policies, but extend this protection to devices in your organization.

### Task 1 â€“ Enable device onboarding

In this task, you will turn on device onboarding for your organization.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Microsoft Purview portal tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal in the left navigation pane, select **Settings** and select **Device onboarding**.
             
             **Note:** If **Turn on device onboarding** is greyed out, complete the following:
             1. Open Edge browser in an InPrivate Window
             2. Navigate to **https://security.microsoft.com**
             3. Log in with your admin credentials that were provided to you.
             4. Select **Settings**
             5. Select **Microsoft 365 Defender**
             6. You should receive a **Hang on!!** notification. This will prepare your environment for onboarding.
             7.  After a few minutes, refresh the browser
             8.  If you see the **Account** option, the environment is ready.
             9.  Close the InPrivate browser window.
             10.  Back in the browser Joni is logged into Purview with, refresh the **Device Onboarding** page.

1. Select **Turn on device onboarding** to enable the solution for your tenant.
  
1. Accept the **Turn on device onboarding** dialog by selecting **OK**.

1. Accept the **Device monitoring is being turned on** dialog by selecting **OK**.

You have now enabled device onboarding and can start to onboard Windows 10 devices to be protected with Endpoint DLP policies. The process of enabling the feature may take up to 30 minutes, but you may proceed with the next task as it's not dependant on this.

### Task 2 - Onboard a device to Endpoint DLP

In this task, you will use the local script option to onboard a Windows 10 device to allow it to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

1. Log into the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

You have successfully onboarded a device and joined it to Azure AD to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

### Task 3 - Create and Endpoint DLP policy

In this task, you will create a Data Loss Prevention policy in the Microsoft Purview portal to protect sensitive data residing on Windows 10 devices in your organization.

1. Select **+ Add condition** and then select **Content contains** from the dropdown menu.

1. In the newly opened **Content contains** area, select **Add** and select **sensitive info types** from the dropdown menu.

1. In the right-side pane **Sensitive info types**, select **Contoso Employee IDs** and **Contoso Disease List** and select **Add**.

1. Change the **Any of these** dropdown to **All of these** to make the policy detect both information in proximity.

1. Select **Next** and review the policy configuration.

1. Select **Submit** to create the policy.

1. Once the policy is created select **Done**.

You have successfully activated the DLP Policy. If the policy detects an attempt to copy content from a file containing credit card information, it will now block the attempt and inform your user.

### Task 4 - Configure Endpoint DLP Settings

In this task, you will configure a file path exclusion to a folder on your Windows 10 devices to make sure that the content of this folder is not monitored by the Endpoint DLP policy you created.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Microsoft Purview portal tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal, on the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Data loss prevention**.

1. In the **Data loss prevention** window, select the **Endpoint DLP settings** tab.

1. Close the browser window.

You have now configured custom settings for your Endpoint DLP policies. Every policy you create will ignore content in the folder you configured and the Google Chrome browser has been added as unallowed browser to handle sensitive data.

### Task 5 - Configure Microsoft Purview Extension

As Compliance Administrator you need to evaluate the new business requirement of rolling out the Chrome browser to severals users for working with sensitive data. For this test, you will install the Google Chrome browser to Client 01 and then add the Purview Compliance Extension for Google manually from the Google web store.
