# Exercise 3 - Explore Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI

Contoso is integrating AI tools into their daily operations and needs to ensure that sensitive data remains secure when interacting with AI systems like Microsoft 365 Copilot. They also want to make sure they comply with industry regulations for AI use. To do this, Contoso will use Microsoft Purview's DSPM for AI, which provides security recommendations and helps set up policies to protect data and detect risky or unethical behavior in AI interactions. In this lab, you will review and apply recommended policies to keep data secure and compliant with AI regulations.

**Task**:

1. Explore and Apply DSPM for AI Recommendations

## Task 1 - Explore and Apply DSPM for AI Recommendations

In this task, you'll explore DSPM for AI recommendations to find the best security policies for Contoso. These recommendations focus on data protection, detecting risky behavior, and ensuring compliance with AI standards like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.

1. In Microsoft Purview, navigate to DSPM for AI by selecting **Solutions** > **DSPM for AI**.

1. Select **Recommendations** from the left sidebar and explore the available recommendations for creating policies.

1. Select **Fortify your data security** and review the details.

   This recommendation creates a DLP policy using Adaptive Protection to block or warn users with elevated risk from pasting or uploading sensitive information into AI applications, such as Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.

1. Select **Create policies** to apply this recommendation.

1. Close the flyout page, then select **Policies** from the left sidebar.

1. On the **Policies** page, view the status and solutions of the policies created from the previous recommendations. Here, you can choose to **Edit policy in solution** and **Investigate alerts** generated by the policies.

You have successfully applied DSPM for AI recommendations to protect Contoso's data. These include data protection policies for AI applications, communication monitoring for Copilot, and compliance with AI regulations. These measures help ensure Contoso's data is secure when using AI tools.
