# Exercise 1 - Create Custom Sensitive Information Types

As Contoso adopts more AI-powered tools, it's crucial to protect sensitive data from accidental exposure. To prevent the sharing of employee IDs, you'll create custom sensitive information types. These will help Contoso detect and classify sensitive data in emails and documents, ensuring it stays protected from misuse.

In this exercise, you'll create a custom sensitive information type to identify employee IDs.
