# Exercise 2 - Create sensitivity labels

Contoso is starting to use Microsoft 365 Copilot to improve productivity, and they need to make sure that sensitive HR data is kept secure. HR deals with confidential information like employee records, salary details, and performance reviews, so it's important that only authorized personnel can access or edit these files. Sensitivity labels are a way to protect this information and ensure that even when using tools like Copilot, the right protections are in place.

In this lab, you'll create and configure sensitivity labels that Contoso's HR department can use to protect their documents and keep them safe while using Microsoft 365 tools.

**Tasks**:

1. Enable support for sensitivity labels
1. Create sensitivity labels
1. Publish sensitivity labels

## Task 1 – Enable co-authoring for files with sensitivity labels

In this task, you'll enable co-authoring for files that have sensitivity labels. This feature allows multiple users to collaborate on a document while keeping it protected. It also enables sensitivity labels for files in OneDrive and SharePoint, if not already enabled.

1. You should still be logged into the Microsoft Purview portal as Megan Bowen.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings**.

1. On the **Settings** page, select **Information Protection**.

1. On the **Information Protection settings** page, select the **Co-authoring for files with sensitivity labels** tab.

1. Select the checkbox for **Turn on co-authoring for files with sensitivity labels**.

   This also enables sensitivity label support SharePoint and OneDrive.

1. Select **Apply** at the bottom of the page.

You've successfully enabled co-authoring for files with sensitivity labels. Now, multiple users can securely edit documents in real time, and sensitivity label support is active in OneDrive and SharePoint

## Task 2 – Create sensitivity labels

In this task, you'll create a sensitivity label for Contoso's HR department to protect internal documents. These labels help control who can access and share sensitive information, such as employee data. By applying this label, you'll ensure only authorized HR personnel can access these documents, even when using Microsoft 365 Copilot.

1. In the Microsoft Purview portal, select **Solutions** from the left sidebar, then select **Information Protection**.

1. Select **Sensitivity labels** from the left sidebar.

1. On the **Sensitivity labels** page select **+ Create a label**.

1. The **New sensitivity label** configuration will start. On the **Provide basic details for this label**, enter:

    - **Name**: `Internal`
    - **Display name**: `Internal`
    - **Description for users**: `Internal sensitivity label.`
    - **Description for admins**: `Internal sensitivity label for Contoso.`

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Define the scope for this label** page, ensure that only **Files** and **Emails** are selected under **Items**. If **Meetings** is selected, deselect it.

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose protection settings for labeled items** page, select **Next**.

1. On the **Auto-labeling for files and emails** page, select **Next**.

1. On the **Define protection settings for groups and sites** page, select **Next**.

1. On the **Auto-labeling for schematized data assets (preview)** page, select **Next**.

1. On the **Review your settings and finish** page, select **Create label**.

1. On the **Your sensitivity label was created** page, select **Don't create a policy yet**, then select **Done**.

You have successfully created an internal sensitivity label to protect company documents. This label will be the base for more specific labels, like the one for HR data.

## Task 3 – Create a sublabel for HR Employee Data

In this task, you'll create a sublabel under the **Internal** sensitivity label to protect HR documents. Dynamic watermarking will be added to display personalized details, such as the user’s email and access timestamp, on documents. This feature discourages unauthorized sharing and provides visibility into document usage.

1. On the **Sensitivity labels** page, find the newly created **Internal** sensitivity label.

1. Select the vertical ellipsis (**...**) next to **Internal** sensitivity label, then select **+ Create sublabel** from the dropdown menu.

   - **Users have offline access to the content for this many days**: 15
   - Select the **Assign permissions** link.

## Task 4 – Publish sensitivity labels

Now that you've created the sensitivity labels, you'll publish them so they can be applied to HR documents across Contoso. This will make sure that HR files stay protected, and that tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot respect the rules set by these labels to prevent unauthorized access or accidental sharing.
