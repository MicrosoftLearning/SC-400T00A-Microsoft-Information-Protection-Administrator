# Lab 2 - Exercise 2 - Manage Endpoint DLP

You are Joni Sherman, the newly hired Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company offering driving instruction in the United States and you need to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization. For this reason, you decide to not only implement Microsoft 365 DLP policies but extend this protection to devices in your organization.

## Task 1 â€“ Enable device onboarding

In this task, you will turn on device onboarding for your organization.

1. You should still be logged into Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. Sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Microsoft Purview portal tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal in the left navigation pane, select **Settings** and select **Device onboarding**.

1. Select **Turn on device onboarding** to enable the solution for your tenant.

1. Accept the **Turn on device onboarding** dialog by selecting **OK**.

1. Accept the **Device monitoring is being turned on** dialog by selecting **OK**.

You have now enabled device onboarding and can start to onboard Windows 10 devices to be protected with Endpoint DLP policies. The process of enabling the feature may take up to 30 minutes, but you may proceed with the next task as it's not dependent on this.

## Task 2 - Onboard a device to Endpoint DLP

In this task, you will use the local script option to onboard a Windows 10 device to allow it to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

1. Log into Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com** and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**.

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal on the left navigation pane, select **Settings** and select **Device onboarding**.

1. On the **Device onboarding** page, in the navigation pane, select **Onboarding**.

1. In the **Deployment method** dropdown menu, select **Local Script (for up to 10 machines)** and select **Download package**.

1. In the download dialog, select **Save**, then select **Open folder**.

1. Extract the Zip-file to the **Desktop** of LON-CL1. You should see a script named **DeviceComplianceLocalOnboardingScript.cmd**.

1. On the desktop right-click the **DeviceComplianceLocalOnboardingScript.cmd** file you just extracted and select **Run as administrator**.  You might encounter a Windows SmartScreen warning box, if you do choose **more info** and then choose **Run anyway**.  If you encounter the User Account Control window, select **Yes** to all this script to make changes to your PC.

1. In the **Command Prompt** screen type **Y** to confirm, and then press Enter.

1. When the script completes **Press any key to continue**.  It can take a minute to complete the onboarding.

1. Open the start menu then find and select **Access work or school**.

1. In the **Access work or school** window, select **+ Connect**.

1. In the **Set up a work or school account** dialog, select the **Join this device to Azure Active Directory** link and sign in as **Joni Sherman** JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

1. In the **Make sure this is your organization** dialog, review the tenant URL and select **Join**.  

    > **Note**: If your device fails to join you may need to troubleshoot your Azure AD configuration join settings. Do the following to ensure devices may be joined: <br> 1. Open a new browser tab and go to the Azure Portal https://portal.azure.com <br> 2. Sign in as **MOD Administrator**, admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com
    <br> 3. Select **Manage Azure Active Directory**.
    <br> 4. Select **Devices**
    <br>5. Select **Device settings**
    <br>6. Scroll-down until you see **Maximum number of devices per user** change the value to **20 (Recommended)**
    <br>7. Once you have updated the setting re-try to connect your device.

1. Once your device has connected select **Done**.

1. Restart Client 1 VM (LON-CL1).

You have successfully onboarded a device and joined it to Azure AD to be protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

## Task 3 - Create an Endpoint DLP policy

In this task, you will create a Data Loss Prevention policy in the Microsoft Purview portal to protect sensitive data residing on Windows 10 devices in your organization. The DLP Policy that you create will block your users if they want to copy content from documents that contain Credit Card information.

1. Log on to Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the lon-cl1\admin account.

1. Open Microsoft Edge from the taskbar, navigate to the Microsoft Purview portal at https://compliance.microsoft.com and when the Sign in window is displayed, sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal on the left navigation pane, expand **Data loss prevention** the select **Policies**.

1. Select **+ Create policy** to start the wizard for creating a new data loss prevention policy.

1. Close the browser window.

You have now configured custom settings for your Endpoint DLP policies. Every policy you create will ignore content in the folder you configured and the Google Chrome browser has been added as unallowed browser to handle sensitive data.

## Task 5 - Configure Microsoft Purview Extension

As Compliance Administrator you need to evaluate the new business requirement of rolling out the Chrome browser to several users for working with sensitive data. For this test, you will install the Google Chrome browser to Client 01 and then add the Purview Compliance Extension for Google manually from the Google web store.

1. Open the Edge browser from the task bar.

1. Navigate to the Google Chrome download at **https://chrome.google.com**.
